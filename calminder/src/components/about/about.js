                        Why mindfulness in education?

                    <div className={styles.left}>
                        <p>Mindfulness is the ability to be aware of 
                           what is happening in the present moment,
                           without any judgement. It is a basic human
                           ability that everyone has, that we can cultivate and train by practice.
                           During mindfulness exercises, we are invited to
                           pay attention to thoughts, sounds, smell, observations,
                           emotions, parts of the body or the sensations of breathing,
                           and to bring our attention back to the object of focus whenever the mind starts to wander.
                           Another form of exercise is not using a specific focus yet training to stay aware of where the
                            attention moves to. A third group of exercises are often called 'informal exercises':
                           we train ourselves by paying more attention to specific actions, situations and interactions in our daily lives.
                           For example, we drink tea, brush our hair, or walk to the next room with our full awareness. </p>

                        <p>With guidance and training, mindfulness
                            can develop into a way of living that
                            brings greater focus and effectiveness as
                            well as kindness and caring in everything
                            we do.</p>

                        <p>Childhood is an important formative and
                            developmental stage that lays the foundation
                            for well-being and mental health
                            in later years and adulthood. The
